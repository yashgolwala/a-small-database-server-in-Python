# a-small-database-server-in-Python
you will have a chance to gain experience with the Python programming language. Python is an easy to use, dynamically typed Object Oriented language. It is syntactically similar to C-style languages like C++, C# and Java, but is somewhat simpler to understand, at least at the modest level of skill required for this assignment. Your job will be to develop a small database server. Ordinarily, this would be a significant undertaking. However, with Python, this will be surprisingly straightforward and requires a relatively trivial amount of code.
