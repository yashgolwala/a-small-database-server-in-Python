# a-small-database-server-in-Python
<p>You will have a chance to gain experience with the Python programming language. Python is an easy to use, dynamically typed Object Oriented language. It is syntactically similar to C-style languages like C++, C# and Java, but is somewhat simpler to understand, at least at the modest level of skill required for this project.</p>

<p>Your job will be to develop a small database server. Ordinarily, this would be a significant undertaking. However, with Python, this will be surprisingly straightforward and requires a relatively trivial amount of code.</p>

<p>
You will also build a trivial client application to access the server. Again, you can use the sample code on the main python website as a starting point. The idea is that you will send a request (just a text string) to the server and ask for a specific task to be performed. The possible requests are as follows:</p>
<br><ol><li>Python DB Menu</li>
  <li> Find customer</li> 
  <li> Add customer</li>
  <li> Delete customer</li> 
  <li> Update customer</li> 
  <li> Update customer</li> 
  <li> Update customer age address phone</li>
  <li> Print report</li>
  <li> Exit</li>
  <br>
  <li>Select:</li></ol>
